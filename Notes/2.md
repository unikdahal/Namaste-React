# Understanding Package.json and Building with Parcel

## Package.json: The NPM Configuration

- **What is Package.json?**
  - It's the configuration hub for npm projects.

- **Why do we need Package.json?**
  - It keeps tabs on dependencies, both regular and dev.

## Initializing NPM

To start with npm swiftly: `npm init -y`

- **What's the `-y` for?**
  - It bypasses the init prompts.

## Exploring Bundlers: Webpack, Parcel, Vite

Bundlers ensure your app is ready for deployment. We opt for Parcel.

- **Installing Parcel**
  - Install it as a dev dependency: `npm install -D parcel`

## Dependency Dynamics

Two breeds: Dev Dependencies for development and Production Dependencies for production.

## Unleashing Parcel

Parcel, the powerhouse, offers a multitude of benefits.

- **Advantages of Parcel**

  - Development Build: Efficiently craft your app.
  - Local Server: Quickly see your changes.
  - HRM (Hot Module Replacement): Experience rapid development feedback.
  - C++ File Watching Algorithm: Swiftly track file changes.
  - Efficient Caching: Speed up build times.
  - Image Optimization: Streamline image loading.
  - Minification: Trim down file sizes.
  - Bundling: Organize your code for deployment.
  - Compression: Shrink file sizes for faster load times.
  - Consistent Hashing: Maintain cache consistency.
  - Code Splitting: Load only what's needed.
  - Differential Bundling: Tailor bundles for diverse browsers.
  - Diagnostic Messages: Receive helpful insights.
  - Tree Shaking: Prune unused code from your bundle.
  - Error Handling: Easily catch and address issues.
  - HTTPS Support: Secure communication with your app.
  - Distinct Dev and Production Builds: Maintain separate development and production environments.

## Hands-on with Parcel

To develop: `npx parcel index.html`

For production build: `npx parcel build index.html`

Remember to remove `main` from `package.json` before building.

## BrowsersList: Tailoring Browser Support

Specify supported browsers in `package.json`.

Example:
```json
"browserslist": [
    "last 1 chrome version"
]
